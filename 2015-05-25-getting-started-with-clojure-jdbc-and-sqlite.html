<h1 class="title">Getting started with JDBC and SQLite in Clojure</h1>
</div>
<p>Using a relational database is, perhaps, not among the most glamorous things you can do from a functional programming language. SQL is, however, very useful for all kinds of real-world tasks. As it turns out, it is also an area where Clojure can show its strengths. Clojure's emphasis on manipulating simple data structures (lists, vectors and hash-maps) also means that working with the results of SQL queries is easy, in many cases obviating the need for a ORM or other helper library. But as a hosted language, Clojure also benefits from access to Java's JDBC database drivers, which essentially means that there is hardly any database out there that you cannot use -- all it takes is an additional line of code.</p>
<p>In this post, I will show how to work with <a href="https://www.sqlite.org">SQLite</a>, an embedded (in-process) database. I chose SQlite because it is easily available and does not require any set up. However, as is the case with JDBC, switching to a database server such as PostgreSQL or MySQL should be as simple as swapping out the connection string.</p>
<p>To approximate a typical Clojure workflow as closely as possible, this walkthrough is presented as the transcript of a REPL session. To follow along, open a REPL using <code>lein repl</code> and type each line as presented here. I'd encourage you to actually type out each line to get a feel for how the library works.</p>
<p>Note that to follow along you don't need a <code>leiningen</code> project; a session opened from a directory without a <code>project.clj</code> will be sufficient. However, I am using the useful <code>vinyasa.pull/pull</code> function which allows you to pull in <code>jar</code> files with external dependencies into a running REPL.</p>
<p>Clojure's main interface to SQL databases the <code>java.jdbc</code> package. To get started, we're going to need a database connection:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(./pull &#39;org.clojure/java.jdbc <span class="st">&quot;0.3.7&quot;</span>)

<span class="co">;; {[org.clojure/clojure &quot;1.4.0&quot;] nil, [org.clojure/java.jdbc &quot;0.3.7&quot;]</span>
<span class="co">;; #{[org.clojure/clojure &quot;1.4.0&quot;]}}</span>

(<span class="kw">require</span> &#39;[clojure.java.jdbc <span class="kw">:as</span> sql])</code></pre></div>
<p>We'll also need a database connection:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(<span class="kw">def</span><span class="fu"> db </span>{<span class="kw">:classname</span>   <span class="st">&quot;org.sqlite.JDBC&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">:subprotocol</span> <span class="st">&quot;sqlite&quot;</span>, <span class="kw">:subname</span>
<span class="st">&quot;test.db&quot;</span>})</code></pre></div>
<p>Let's start by executing a simple query:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(sql/query db <span class="st">&quot;select 3*5 as result&quot;</span>)

<span class="co">;; SQLException No suitable driver found for jdbc:sqlite:test.db</span>
<span class="co">;; java.sql.DriverManager.getConnection (DriverManager.java:689)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Apparently installing the <code>clojure.java/jdbc</code> jar does not automatically pull in the <code>sqlite</code> JDBC driver. We need to add this dependency explicitly:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(./pull &#39;org.xerial/sqlite-jdbc <span class="st">&quot;3.7.2&quot;</span>)

(sql/query db <span class="st">&quot;select 3*5 as result&quot;</span>)
<span class="co">;; =&gt; ({:result 15})</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Ok, now it works. The call to <code>query</code> returns a single row with a single column, which we can extract easily:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(<span class="kw">-&gt;</span> (sql/query db <span class="st">&quot;select 3*5 as result&quot;</span>) <span class="kw">first</span> <span class="kw">:result</span>)
<span class="co">;; =&gt; 15</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's create a table:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(sql/execute! db [<span class="st">&quot;drop table if exists countries&quot;</span>])
(<span class="kw">let</span> [cs (sql/create-table-ddl <span class="kw">:countries</span>
                               [<span class="kw">:id</span> <span class="kw">:integer</span>
                                <span class="kw">:primary</span> <span class="kw">:key</span>
                                <span class="kw">:autoincrement</span>]
                               [<span class="kw">:name</span> <span class="kw">:text</span>]
                               [<span class="kw">:capital</span> <span class="kw">:text</span>])]
  (sql/execute! db [cs]))</code></pre></div>
<p>You can see that we wrap the string containing the SQL statement in a vector. The reason is that <code>execute!</code> supports prepared statements, where the SQL string includes placeholders such as <code>?</code>. <a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> On execution, the placeholders in the query will be filled on the database side with the values provided. This is generally more efficient than including values in the SQL string, as the DBMS does not need to parse the values as strings. It is also more secure, as it rules out the possibility of SQL injection attacks. For these reasons, parameterized SQL queries should be used whenever possible.</p>
<p>That's why there's a vector in the example. <code>execute!</code> expects, as its second parameter, a sequence of the form <code>[sql-string param1 param2 ...]</code>. So you can perform an <code>INSERT</code> in this way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(sql/execute! db [<span class="st">&quot;insert into countries (name, capital) values (?, ?)&quot;</span>
                  <span class="st">&quot;Denmark&quot;</span>
                  <span class="st">&quot;Copenhagen&quot;</span>])</code></pre></div>
<p>However, there's a simple convenience function that takes care of creating the SQL statement for you:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">
(sql/insert! db <span class="kw">:countries</span> {<span class="kw">:name</span> <span class="st">&quot;France&quot;</span>,
                            <span class="kw">:capital</span> <span class="st">&quot;Paris&quot;</span>})</code></pre></div>
<p>We can also insert multiple rows in one go by passing multiple hash-maps as arguments to the <code>insert!</code> function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">
(<span class="kw">def</span><span class="fu"> pairs </span>[[<span class="st">&quot;USA&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;Washington, D.C.&quot;</span>]
            [<span class="st">&quot;Argentina&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;Buenos Aires&quot;</span>]
            [<span class="st">&quot;Peru&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;Lima&quot;</span>]])

(<span class="kw">apply</span> sql/insert! db <span class="kw">:countries</span>
       (<span class="kw">map</span> (<span class="kw">partial</span> zipmap [<span class="kw">:name</span> <span class="kw">:capital</span>]) pairs))</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can retrieve the rows we just inserted:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(sql/query db <span class="st">&quot;select id, name, capital from countries&quot;</span>)

<span class="co">;; =&gt; ({:capital &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, :name &quot;Denmark&quot;, :id 1}</span>
<span class="co">;;     {:capital &quot;Paris&quot;, :name &quot;France&quot;, :id 2}</span>
<span class="co">;;     {:capital &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot;, :name &quot;USA&quot;, :id 3}</span>
<span class="co">;;     {:capital &quot;Buenos Aires&quot;, :name &quot;Argentina&quot;, :id 4}</span>
<span class="co">;;     {:capital &quot;Lima&quot;, :name &quot;Peru&quot;, :id 5})</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>query</code> accepts a simple string as its second argument, but we can also supply a parameterized query:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(<span class="kw">-&gt;</span> (sql/query db [<span class="st">&quot;select id  from countries where name=?&quot;</span> <span class="st">&quot;Argentina&quot;</span>])
    <span class="kw">first</span>
    <span class="kw">:id</span>)
<span class="co">;; =&gt; 4</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Back in the command line, we can now verify that *SQLite` has written the data to disk:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash">$ <span class="kw">sqlite3</span> test.db .dump
<span class="kw">PRAGMA</span> foreign_keys=OFF<span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">BEGIN</span> TRANSACTION<span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">CREATE</span> TABLE countries (id integer primary key autoincrement, name text, capital text);
<span class="kw">INSERT</span> INTO <span class="st">&quot;countries&quot;</span> VALUES(1,<span class="st">&#39;Denmark&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;Copenhagen&#39;</span>);
<span class="kw">INSERT</span> INTO <span class="st">&quot;countries&quot;</span> VALUES(2,<span class="st">&#39;France&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;Paris&#39;</span>);
<span class="kw">INSERT</span> INTO <span class="st">&quot;countries&quot;</span> VALUES(3,<span class="st">&#39;USA&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;Washington, D.C.&#39;</span>);
<span class="kw">INSERT</span> INTO <span class="st">&quot;countries&quot;</span> VALUES(4,<span class="st">&#39;Argentina&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;Buenos Aires&#39;</span>);
<span class="kw">INSERT</span> INTO <span class="st">&quot;countries&quot;</span> VALUES(5,<span class="st">&#39;Peru&#39;</span>,<span class="st">&#39;Lima&#39;</span>);
<span class="kw">DELETE</span> FROM sqlite_sequence<span class="kw">;</span>
<span class="kw">INSERT</span> INTO <span class="st">&quot;sqlite_sequence&quot;</span> VALUES(<span class="st">&#39;countries&#39;</span>,5);
<span class="kw">COMMIT;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="reusing-database-connection">Reusing database connection</h2>
<p>All functions in <code>clojure.java.jdbc</code> expect a database specification as their first argument. In the examples we have been passing a map containing connection information to these functions. This is very convenient for experimenting in the REPL. However, this also means that each database interaction requires establishing a new connection or, in the case SQLite, closing and re-opening the <code>.db3</code> file. While this is usually fast enough for interactive use, it is inefficient when used in a production system.</p>
<p>In other words, <code>java.jdbc</code> does not try to be smart by guessing that you're going to need to perform multiple queries on your database connection. That's a feature, not a bug, as handling expensive resources such as open database connections should be left as an explicit job of the programmer, making the scope in which the resource is available obvious.</p>
<p>In Clojure you can use a convenient macro for this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(sql/with-db-connection [db-handle db]
  (<span class="kw">doall</span> (sql/query db-handle [<span class="st">&quot;select count(*) as count from countries&quot;</span>]))
  <span class="co">;; do more things with the connection</span>
  )</code></pre></div>
<p>The macro <code>with-db-connections</code> is modelled on the syntax of <code>let</code>. With <code>let</code> you can bind variables to a value within a certain scope:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(<span class="kw">let</span> [a <span class="dv">123</span>]
  (<span class="kw">println</span> a) <span class="co">;; here &quot;a&quot; is accessible</span>
  )
<span class="co">;; now &quot;a&quot; is no longer accessible</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Similarly, the function <code>with-open</code> keeps a file open and its handle operational for any operations, but only within a certain scope:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode clojure"><code class="sourceCode clojure">(<span class="kw">with-open</span> [rdr (clojure.java.io/reader <span class="st">&quot;/etc/group&quot;</span>)]
  (<span class="kw">-&gt;&gt;</span> rdr <span class="kw">line-seq</span> <span class="kw">first</span>))
<span class="co">;; =&gt; root:x:0:</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After execution proceeds beyond the scope of the <code>with-open</code> macro, the resource is automatically freed (the file handle closed).</p>
<p>The macro <code>with-db-connection</code> has the same signature. We can see verify this from the REPL:</p>
<pre><code>user=&gt; (doc sql/with-db-connection)
-------------------------
clojure.java.jdbc/with-db-connection
([binding &amp; body])
Macro
  Evaluates body in the context of an active connection to the database.
  (with-db-connection [con-db db-spec]
  ... con-db ...)</code></pre>
<p>The macro's first argument is expected to be a &quot;binding&quot;, which in Clojure-speak is a pair, i.e. a <em>vector</em> with two elements. The second element is the resource to be made available to the body macro. The first element is the name of the binding. If you use the variable &quot;db-handle&quot; within the scope of the macro, it will re-use the current database connection. Once execution moves beyond its confines, the connection will be cleaned up automatically. <a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Finally, connection re-use can only work if you supply <code>db-handle</code> to query functions instead of <code>db</code>, i.e. the binding generated by the macro rather than the original connection map.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have seen that interacting with a relational database requires very little bureaucracy in Clojure. Its database functions are polymorphic in that they accept different types of values as <em>database specifications</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>a map describing how to connect to the database (in the case of SQLite including the file name, otherwise including a host name, user name and password)</li>
<li>a binding generated by the <code>with-db-connection</code> macro</li>
</ul>
<p>But the same abstraction also allows two other types of handles as arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>a binding generated by <a href="https://clojure.github.io/java.jdbc/#clojure.java.jdbc/with-db-transaction">the <code>with-db-transaction</code> macro</a>, which causes the queries performed using the specification to be executed in the context of a database transaction (which can be rolled back or committed atomically)</li>
<li>a handle representing a <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/connection_pooling.html">connection pool</a>, which allows a long-running multithreaded program to make use of a certain number of persistent database connections (not applicable for SQLite)</li>
</ul>
<p>Database specifications, then, provide a common interface for different patterns of interacting with relational databases. While reconnecting to the database may be sufficient when experimenting form the REPL, a production deployment will typically require a database pool, which fortunately is not difficult to set up as well.</p>
<p>For more on the using SQL databases in Clojure, check out the official <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/home.html">java.jdbc tutorial</a> and the generated <a href="http://clojure.github.io/java.jdbc/">API documentation</a>. The chapter <a href="https://github.com/clojure-cookbook/clojure-cookbook/blob/master/06_databases/6-03_manipulating-an-SQL-database.asciidoc">in the Clojure Cookbook</a> is relevant as well. Finally, it may also be useful to have a look at Sun's official <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html">JDBC documentation</a>, much of which applies also to Clojure.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>Unfortunately you'll need to use positional (indexed) parameters (multiple occurrences of <code>?</code>) as JDBC <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/2309984/239678">does not support</a> named parameters (<code>:name</code> and <code>:capital</code>) out of the box, a feature that lesser languages have provided for a while.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>This is also the reason why the example includes an explicit call to the function <code>doall</code>. When you use <code>with-db-connection</code> and its cognates, you may run into a gotcha related to the fact that <code>query</code> returns a <em>lazy sequence</em>. The problem is that when the REPL, in printing, retrieves the values form (realizes) the lazy-sequence, the macro may have already closed the database connection. As a consequence you'll see a puzzling error stating that the connection is already closed. The solution, as in other similar cases, is to force the realization of the sequence using <code>doall</code> while the connection is still open. Note, however, that <code>query</code> usually calls <code>doall</code> on its result set (the behavior is described <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/ecosystem/java_jdbc/using_sql.html#processing-a-result-set-lazilyly">here</a>).<a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p></li>
